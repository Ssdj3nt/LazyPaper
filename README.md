# LazyPaper

LazyPaper is a "dumb" application written in C.

As the name suggests, it's useful for lazy people who, when they want to change their desktop wallpaper on Hyprland with Hyprpaper, find it cumbersome to manually create or modify the file in /home/<username>/.config/Hypr/hyprpaper.conf.

# Normal Usage

1. Download the binary file, such as 'LazyPaper-v0.10'.
2. Open a terminal in the directory where the binary file is located.
3. Type './LazyPaper-v0.10' and press Enter.
4. Drag and drop the wallpaper you want to set into the terminal window.
