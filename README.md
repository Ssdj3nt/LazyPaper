# LazyPaper

LazyPaper is a "dumb" application written in C.

As the name suggests, it's useful for lazy people who, when they want to change their desktop wallpaper on Hyprland with Hyprpaper, find it cumbersome to manually create or modify the file in /home/<username>/.config/Hypr/hyprpaper.conf.
